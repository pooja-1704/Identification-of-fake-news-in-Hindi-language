# Identification-of-fake-news-in-Hindi-language
In this project, I developed a hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and other techniques to efficiently identify fake news in the Hindi language. The model analyzes textual data, extracting relevant features through CNN and leveraging the sequence modeling capabilities of RNN to improve classification accuracy and handle the complexities of natural language processing in Hindi. The project aims to contribute to the detection of misinformation, particularly in Indian language content.
